# Beadle’s++ – AdNU's Attendance Management App

Beadle’s++ is an enhanced mobile application built in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) designed for student beadles of Ateneo de Naga University to efficiently manage and record classroom attendance in a much more reliable, convenient, and accessible way.
